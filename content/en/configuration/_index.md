These pages provide the *as built* configuration for ASD's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud*.
 
The settings described on these pages should be used to provide reference of a baseline implementation for a system configured using the blueprint. Any implementation implied by these pages should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.
 
Implementation of the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisationâ€™s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.
 
Placeholders such as `<ORGANISATION.GOV.AU>`, `<BLUEPRINT.GOV.AU>` and `<TENANT-NAME>` should be replaced with the relevant details as required.
