The below tables outline the *as built* configuration for ASD's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* (the Blueprint) for the Entra ID portal blade at the following URL:

https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/MultifactorAuthenticationMenuBlade/~/Notifications
 
The settings described in these tables should be used to provide reference to a baseline implementation for a system configured using the Blueprint. Any implementation implied by these pages should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.

Implementation of the guidance provided by the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisationâ€™s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.

Placeholders such as `<ORGANISATION.GOV.AU>`, `<BLUEPRINT.GOV.AU>` and `<TENANT-NAME>` should be replaced with the relevant details as required.
