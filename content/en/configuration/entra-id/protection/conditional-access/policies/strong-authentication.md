{{% alert title="Instruction" color="dark" %}}

The below tables outline the *as built* configuration for ASD's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* (the Blueprint) for the Microsoft Entra admin portal at the following URL:

<https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies>

The settings described on these pages provide a baseline implementation for a system configured using the Blueprint. Any implementation implied by these pages should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.

Implementation of the guidance provided by the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisationâ€™s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.

Placeholders such as `<ORGANISATION.GOV.AU>`, `<BLUEPRINT.GOV.AU>` and `<TENANT-NAME>` should be replaced with the relevant details as required.

In order to meet ASD Essential Eight Maturity Level 2 requirements, this policy has been updated to use an Authentication Strength that enforces the use of phishing-resistant MFA methods. This excludes the use of number matching push notifications in Microsoft Authenticator as was previously documented.

The use of [passkeys with Microsoft Authenticator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-enable-authenticator-passkey) is in public preview.

Before implementing these settings, organisations should continue to ensure that any settings meet their operational and security requirements.
