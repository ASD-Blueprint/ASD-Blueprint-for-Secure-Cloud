{{% alert title="Instruction" color="dark" %}}

The below pages outline the *as built* configuration for ASD's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* (the Blueprint) for the Microsoft Entra admin portal at the following URL:

<https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies>

The settings described on these pages provide a baseline implementation for a system configured using the Blueprint. Any implementation implied by these pages should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.

Implementation of the guidance provided by the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisationâ€™s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.

Placeholders such as `<ORGANISATION.GOV.AU>`, `<BLUEPRINT.GOV.AU>` and `<TENANT-NAME>` should be replaced with the relevant details as required.

An existing security group must be specified to act as a Conditional Access exclusion group.

All Conditional Access policies in the DSC are set to either report only or disabled, and will need to be enabled manually.

Microsoft-managed policies may be created as a result of other Entra ID settings and identified by a *MICROSOFT-MANAGED* tag. These policies can be disabled as they're superseded by Blueprint policies.
