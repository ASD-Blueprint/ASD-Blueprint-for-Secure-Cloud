{{% alert title="Instruction" color="dark" %}}

The below pages outline the *as built* configuration for ASD's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* (the Blueprint) for the Entra ID portal blade at the following URL:

https://entra.microsoft.com/
 
The settings described on these pages should be used to provide reference to a baseline implementation for a system configured using the Blueprint. Any implementation implied by these pages should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.

Implementation of the guidance provided by the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisationâ€™s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.
 
When using automated configuration files, organisations should note they will configure the relevant settings in a Microsoft 365 tenancy exactly as outlined in the Configuration pages of the Blueprint. Organisations should ensure they customise configuration of their Microsoft 365 tenancies in accordance with their own design decisions and requirements, deviating from the Blueprint (including automated configuration files) where appropriate.

Placeholders such as `<ORGANISATION.GOV.AU>`, `<BLUEPRINT.GOV.AU>` and `<TENANT-NAME>` should be replaced with the relevant details as required.

- An Acceptable Use policy, for the GRANT - Terms of use policy.

All Conditional Access Policies are set to report only in the DSC and will need to be enabled manually.

2: IP addresses must be configured manually. Refer to [Named Locations]({{<ref "protection/conditional-access/named-locations">}}) for configuration guidance.
