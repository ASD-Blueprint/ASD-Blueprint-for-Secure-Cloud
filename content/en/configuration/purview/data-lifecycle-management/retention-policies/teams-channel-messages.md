The below tables outline the *as built* configuration for ASD's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* (the Blueprint) for the Microsoft Purview portal at the following URL:

<https://purview.microsoft.com/datalifecyclemanagement/retention>

The settings described on these pages provide a baseline implementation for a system configured using the Blueprint. Any implementation implied by these pages should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.

Implementation of the guidance provided by the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisationâ€™s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.

Placeholders such as `<ORGANISATION.GOV.AU>`, `<BLUEPRINT.GOV.AU>` and `<TENANT-NAME>` should be replaced with the relevant details as required.

Retention policies are enabled by default after creation. Administrators should be aware of the potential for some references to Microsoft 365 groups to remain following deletion as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/retention-settings#what-happens-if-a-microsoft-365-group-is-deleted-after-a-policy-is-applied).
