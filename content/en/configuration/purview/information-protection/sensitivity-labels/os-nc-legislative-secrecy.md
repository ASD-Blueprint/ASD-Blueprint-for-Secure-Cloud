{{% alert title="Instruction" color="dark" %}}

The below tables outline the *as built* configuration for ASD's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* (the Blueprint) for the Microsoft Purview portal at the following URL:

<https://purview.microsoft.com/informationprotection/informationprotectionlabels/sensitivitylabels>

The settings described on these pages provide a baseline implementation for a system configured using the Blueprint. Any implementation implied by these pages should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.

Implementation of the guidance provided by the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisationâ€™s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.

Placeholders such as `<ORGANISATION.GOV.AU>`, `<BLUEPRINT.GOV.AU>` and `<TENANT-NAME>` should be replaced with the relevant details as required.

Prior to configuring sensitivity labels for groups and sites, an additional one-time procedure is required to enable sensitivity labels for containers and to synchronise labels to Entra ID. Instructions for this procedure can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/purview/sensitivity-labels-teams-groups-sites#how-to-enable-sensitivity-labels-for-containers-and-synchronize-labels).
