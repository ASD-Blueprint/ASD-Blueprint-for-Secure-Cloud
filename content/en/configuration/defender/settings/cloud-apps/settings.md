The below tables outline the *as built* configuration for ASD's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* for Defender portal blade at the following URL: 

https://security.microsoft.com/cloudapps/settings
 
These settings should be used to provide reference of a baseline implementation for a system configured using the blueprint. Any implementation implied by the below should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.
 
Implementation of the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisation’s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.
 
Placeholders such as ‘organisation.gov.au’, ‘blueprint.gov.au’ and ‘tenant-name’ should be replaced with the relevant details as required.
