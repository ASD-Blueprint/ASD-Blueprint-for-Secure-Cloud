The below tables outline the *as built* configuration for ASD's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* (the Blueprint) for the SharePoint admin portal at the following URL:

<https://`<TENANT-NAME>`-admin.sharepoint.com/>

`Home` > `Settings`

These settings should be used to provide reference of a baseline implementation for a system configured using the blueprint. Any implementation implied by the below should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.

Implementation of the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisationâ€™s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.

Placeholders such as `<ORGANISATION.GOV.AU>`, `<BLUEPRINT.GOV.AU>` and `<TENANT-NAME>` should be replaced with the relevant details as required.
