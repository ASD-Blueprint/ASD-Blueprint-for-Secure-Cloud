{{% alert title="Instruction" color="dark" %}}

The below tables outline the *as built* configuration for ASD's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* (the Blueprint) for the SharePoint admin portal at the following URL:

https://`<TENANT-NAME>`-admin.sharepoint.com/

`Home` > `Policies` > `Access Control`

These settings should be used to provide reference of a baseline implementation for a system configured using the blueprint. Any implementation implied by the below should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.

Implementation of the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisationâ€™s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.

Placeholders such as `<ORGANISATION.GOV.AU>`, `<BLUEPRINT.GOV.AU>` and `<TENANT-NAME>` should be replaced with the relevant details as required.

Selecting this policy setting will automatically create two Conditional Access policies that will be enabled and scoped to all users. The policies are prefixed with `[SharePoint admin centre]` and will block access to the SharePoint Online service from unmanaged devices and from select device platforms and client applications.
