The below pages outline the *as built* configuration for ASD's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* (the Blueprint) for the Microsoft Teams admin portal at the following URL:

<https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/>

The settings described on these pages provide a baseline implementation for a system configured using the Blueprint. Any implementation implied by these pages should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.

Implementation of the guidance provided by the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisationâ€™s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.

settings in a Microsoft 365 tenancy exactly as outlined in the Configuration pages of the Blueprint. Organisations should ensure they customise configuration of their Microsoft 365 tenancies in accordance with their own design decisions and requirements, deviating from the Blueprint (including automated configuration files) where appropriate.

Placeholders such as `<ORGANISATION.GOV.AU>`, `<BLUEPRINT.GOV.AU>` and `<TENANT-NAME>` should be replaced with the relevant details as required.

Microsoft has introduced a number of changes to the Teams admin centre to unify settings and policies. The new admin experience will soon become the default for all organisations, and the configuration guidance provided here aligns with this updated model.

### Automated Configuration Deployment and Assessment

#### Overview

Some of the Teams configurations can be automatically deployed using Microsoft 365 Desired State Configuration (DSC).

Some of the Teams configurations cannot be assessed using a DSC blueprint. Please refer to those configuration pages to conduct a manual assessment.

Before using the below DSC file, please refer to the [setup]({{<ref "tools/deployment-and-assessment/desired-state-configuration-setup">}}) and [automated deployment]({{<ref "tools/deployment-and-assessment/automated-deployment">}}) pages for instructions.

Do not proceed with the automated deployment instructions until you've familiarised yourself with the [addition configuration](#additional-configuration) required below.

**Desired State Configuration file**<br>Download the {{% download file="/content/files/automation/dsc/asdbpsc-dsc-teams.txt" %}} Teams DSC file {{% /download %}} and rename the linked .txt file to .ps1.

**Configuration data file**<br>Download the {{% download file="/content/files/automation/dsc/configuration-data.txt" %}} configuration data file {{% /download %}} and rename the linked .txt file to .psd1.

{{% alert title="Non-global policy settings" color="info" %}}

Teams includes a number of pre-configured default policies to help simplify onboarding by providing baseline settings for common scenarios. These policies are typically found in the *custom policies* sections of the Teams admin centre.

The DSC file includes settings for managing global policies but does not modify the pre-configured or custom policies.
