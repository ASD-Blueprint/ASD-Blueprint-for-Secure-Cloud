The below tables outline the *as built* configuration for ASD's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* for the Microsoft Exchange Online portal blade at the following URL: 
 
https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/connectors
 
The settings described on these pages should be used to provide reference to a baseline implementation for a system configured using the Blueprint. Any implementation implied by these pages should not be considered as prescriptive as to how an organisation must scope, build, document, or assess a system.

Implementation of the guidance provided by the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisation’s operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks.

Placeholders such as `<ORGANISATION.GOV.AU>`, `<BLUEPRINT.GOV.AU>` and `<TENANT-NAME>` should be replaced with the relevant details as required.

### Cloud-native configuration

Cloud-native connector configuration assumes Office 365 is not configured with a 3rd party gateway for mail flow.

Organisations that are required to route traffic through a 3rd party mail gateway will require connectors to be configured.

#### Inbound mail connector

| Item           | Configuration |
| -------------- | ------------: |
| Not configured |           N/A |

#### Outbound mail connector

| Item           | Configuration |
| -------------- | ------------: |
| Not configured |           N/A |
