Welcome to the Australian Signals Directorate's (ASD's) *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* (the Blueprint), previously known as the Protected Utility Blueprint. The Blueprint is an online tool to support the design, configuration and deployment of collaborative and secure cloud and hybrid workspaces, with a current focus on Microsoft 365.

The Blueprint provides better practice guidance, configuration guides and templates covering risk management, architecture and standard operating procedures developed as per the controls in ASD's [*Information Security Manual* (ISM)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism). While the Blueprint is primarily developed for government organisations, private sector organisations may also find it a useful resource.

The guidance and advice in the Blueprint is informed by ASDâ€™s experience in responding to cyber security incidents, performing vulnerability assessments and penetration testing Australian Government organisations. ASD uses our cyber threat intelligence, and feedback from partners across government and industry, to ensure our cyber security advice is contemporary, fit for purpose and actionable.

To fully realise the benefits offered by cloud computing services, organisations should consider the Blueprint alongside their own unique requirements, risk appetite and organisational culture. Organisations should also refer to ASD's [Cloud Security](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/cloud-security-guidance) guidance suite for further advice on securing the use of cloud computing services.

If you have any questions or suggestions about the Blueprint, or to request targeted technical advice, please get in touch with us at [blueprint@asd.gov.au](mailto:blueprint@asd.gov.au) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/ASD-Blueprint/ASD-Blueprint-for-Secure-Cloud). You can also sign up to ASD's [Cyber Security Partnership Program](https://www.cyber.gov.au/partnershipprogram) to be informed of new cyber security advice and alerted to emerging cyber threats.
