The hardware platform chosen to support the SOE is key to its stability and provides the components that can be configured by the operating system and applications.

The selected processor architecture and associated firmware capability directly influence the supportability of applications and security features of an operating system. The minimum hardware requirements listed below will ensure that the system runs reliably and is supported by the vendor, Microsoft.

Organisations should select a reputable hardware platform that supports enterprise features, such as having an interface to provision zero-touch UEFI configuration and updates.

Organisations wishing to implement virtual desktops or VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) should assess the chosen virtualisation or hypervisor (including cloud platforms) platform to determine the features available meet the desired security risk profile for the organisation.
