description: "This section describes the design decisions associated with Windows features on Windows 10 and 11 endpoints configured according to guidance in ASD's Blueprint for Secure Cloud."

Windows 10 and 11 incorporates optional features that can be enabled to offer additional functionality. When deploying a Windows Standard Operating Environment (SOE), removing unnecessary features from the standard installation creates a simpler image to maintain. In Windows if a feature is not required or used within an environment, its removal means a faster deployment and a simpler user experience.
