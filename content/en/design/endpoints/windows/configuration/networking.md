Windows 10 and 11 contains networking technologies built into the operating system. These features enable Windows to communicate with other networked devices including those on the Internet.

IPv6 can be enabled or disabled within Windows 10 and 11 depending on the network to which the device will be connected. IPv6 should be disabled unless it is exclusively used throughout the network. 

Windows provides support for several wireless networking technologies that enable devices to connect to a wireless network. The two most popular technologies supported in Windows currently are Wi-Fi and Mobile Broadband networking.

802.1x ensures that only appropriate users or devices can connect to a PROTECTED network and that data is secure at the radio transmission level. The Single Sign-On (SSO) feature executes Layer 2 network authentication at the appropriate time given the network security configuration, integrating with the user's Windows logon experience.
