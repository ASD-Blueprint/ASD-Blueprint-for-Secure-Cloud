Licence keys and activation processes are leveraged by Microsoft to ensure that the device or user is eligible to use the feature or run the product (i.e. Windows 10).

Windows 10 and 11 licensing has evolved significantly since the initial release by Microsoft. In addition to the traditional activation methods for on-premises networks (KMS, MAK and AD Based Activation) it is also possible to use Windows Subscription Activation. The evolution of Windows 10 activation is described below:

* Starting from Windows 10 Pro version 1703, Windows 10 Subscription Activation feature enables a step up from Windows 10 Pro edition to Windows 10 Enterprise for those with a qualifying Windows 10 or Microsoft 365 subscription.
* Microsoft Entra ID is available for identity management.

Office 365 products require licensing to enable full functionality and support. The available activation methods are:

* **Office 365 based activation** - Office 365 is Microsoft's productivity solution in the cloud. Office 365 has two sets of suites, one for the small and medium business segment and one for the enterprise segment. These suites are sold across different channels and programs designed to meet each segment's needs. Products are assigned to users and then activated through the online Microsoft Office 365 licensing service.

It is recommended in this design that organisations purchase a Microsoft 365 E5 licence for each user.                                                                                                                                                                              |
