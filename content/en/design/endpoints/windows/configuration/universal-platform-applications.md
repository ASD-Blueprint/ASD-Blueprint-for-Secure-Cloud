Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications are applications that run on Windows 10 and newer devices. Developers can build line of business Windows Store apps using standard programming languages. The Windows Runtime (WinRT) supports C#, C++, JavaScript and Visual Basic.

UWP applications cannot access user resources unless the application specifically declares a need to use those resources. This ensures a clear connection between apps and the types of resources the app has access to.
