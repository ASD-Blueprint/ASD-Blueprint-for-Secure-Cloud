title: "Securing iOS applications"
weight: 10
description: "This section describes the design decisions associated with securing applications on iOS endpoints configured according to guidance in ASD's Blueprint for Secure Cloud."
---

Mobile Application Management (MAM) in Intune enables configuration of managed applications within an iOS device. Managed applications enclose organisation applications within an application bubble. This bubble prevents accidental data spillage by preventing cutting and pasting, as well as enabling data sharing within the application bubble.

MAM provides the capability to configure iOS device applications. These configurations include:

* **Managed Applications** – List of organisation business applications.
* **Managed Application configuration** – Configure and secure managed application configuration within the device. These configurations enable and isolate managed applications to reside next to unmanaged applications.
* **Per-app VPN** - Secure communication between applications on devices, and the Office 365 tenant. This will require the organisations VPN device setup to accept communication from the VPN connection from managed apps.
