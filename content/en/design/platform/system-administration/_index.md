description: "System Administration is the process of managing, troubleshooting, and maintaining the solution. To complete this, system administrators are granted permissions over the solution. The allocation of permissions to administrators should align with the administrator's role within the organisation and the principle of least privileged access. The allocation of permission to the administrator's role is captured within the RBAC policy."

### Administrative portals

To manage and configure the solution, administrators will require access to various administrative portals. These portals are a mixture of server based and web-based portals that exist internally or in the cloud.

Web based administrative portals are provided by Microsoft; however, the URLs for these portals are subject to change. For an up to date complete list of portals required to administer Microsoft see [Microsoft security portals and admin centers](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender/portals?view=o365-worldwide). 

Administrative and security portals required for the Blueprint are listed below.
