Groups can be three types:

* **Privileged** - Platform-owned administrative groups for access to the critical control and management security planes (e.g. subscriptions).
* **Security** -  Resource Owner managed groups for access to data and workload security plane resources (e.g. applications).
* **Microsoft 365** - User managed grouping for more fluid and temporary assignment for collaboration purposes (e.g. email groups, teams).

Users can be assigned to these groups in a number of ways:
 
| Type                                             | Description                                                                                                                               | Usage                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dynamically                                      | Based on a set of fixed rules, usually user metadata                                                                                      | Used by the platform owners for administrative purposes.                                               |
| Assigned Directly                                | The group's owner or those with User Management Roles can assign users directly to the group using the Entra Portal or Group Access Panel | Used by Team Leads for ad hoc assignments to organisational / project based groupings for Microsoft 365 Groups. |
| Privileged Group Activation                      | Specialised group where membership is activated for time-boxed periods using PIM                                                          | Used for privileged groups.                                                                            |
| [Entitlement Packages]({{<ref "governance" >}})  | Assigns users to groups through request and approval process using Access Packages                                                        | Used by Resource Owners to assign users to Security Groups.                                            |

### Microsoft 365 Groups

Microsoft 365 groups (as opposed to security groups) include a suite of linked resources that users can use for communication and collaboration. Groups always include a SharePoint site, a mailbox and calendar, and Stream. Depending on how the group is created other services such as Teams can be optionally added.

Microsoft 365 groups are designed to be user created, enabling them to choose the set of people with whom they wish to collaborate, and easily set up a collection of resources for those people to share. Groups can be created from multiple end-points including Outlook, SharePoint, Teams, and other environments. Adding members to the group automatically grants the needed permissions to all assets provided by the group.

Microsoft 365 Groups includes a variety of governance controls, including an expiration policy, naming conventions, and a blocked words policy, to help manage groups.

*Microsoft recommends self-service to empower group owners and help users get their work done more easily. Limiting group and team creation can slow users productivity because many Microsoft 365 services require that groups be created for the service to function.*
