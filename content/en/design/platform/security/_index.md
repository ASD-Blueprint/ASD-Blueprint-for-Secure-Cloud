Information Technology (IT) Security refers to protection of networks, servers, intranets, data systems, data and computer systems. To protect these items Microsoft Azure contains several security features and products which together:

* **Secure the Platform** – Microsoft Azure and Office 365, through their features and products, enable security in depth.
* **Provide Risk Assessments** – Entra ID Protection, Defender for Identity and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint utilise analytics and machine learning to detect and flag unusual/risky behaviour.
* **Provide Visibility into User Behaviour** – Defender for Cloud Apps provides security operations dashboards which provide visibility into the activities being undertaken within the environment.
* **Control Data Exfiltration** – Data Loss Prevention policies and Defender for Cloud Apps session policies control the flow and protection of information inside and outside of the environment.
