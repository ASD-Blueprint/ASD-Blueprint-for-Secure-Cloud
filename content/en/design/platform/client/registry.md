Registry settings are applied to the Windows registry to modify the underlying operating system. Registry settings are typically changed in a client operating system to configure the system or increase the security of system.

There are several tools available to apply registry settings such as:

* Group Policy
* Microsoft Intune
* Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM)
