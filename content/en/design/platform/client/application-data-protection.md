Within Microsoft Intune, application protection policies are rules that ensure organisations' data remains safe or contained in a managed application. An application protection policy can be a rule that is enforced when the user attempts to access or move 'corporate' data, or a set of actions that are prohibited or monitored when the user is inside the app.
