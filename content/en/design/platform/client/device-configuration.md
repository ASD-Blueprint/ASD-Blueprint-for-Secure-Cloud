Device Configuration Profiles provide the ability to control settings and features on supported endpoints. These include device and user settings, browser settings and hardware settings. Device Configuration Profiles can be deployed to specific users or devices by using Entra ID groups.

There are many supported platforms, each of which have several profile sub-types that they offer configuration for. The following platforms are supported:

* Android device administrator
* Android Enterprise
* iOS/iPadOS
* macOS
* Windows Phone 8.1
* Windows 8.1 and later
* Windows 10 and later

Within each platform there are number of profile types enabling many settings to be configured. The profile types and settings that are configurable vary depending on the platform. In general terms configuration profiles either enable configuration of the device for use by a user, or to enable security of the device through application of controls. Custom profiles can be created for a platform although this should be considered a last resort if the settings are not available in any other way.

In a co-managed state, these settings may be superfluous to existing Group Policies and Standard Operating Environment (SOE) settings.

### Device configuration sets

Different sets of Microsoft Intune Configuration Profiles are used to configure device settings and features based on the security requirements of the activities being performed. These are aligned with the [access roles](/design/platform/identity/roles/):

* **Control Plane** - Highly privileged access for administering the platform.
* **Management Plane** - Privileged Access for deploying and managing workloads and data.
* **User / Application Plane** - Standard access to applications and websites.

| `SOE` Configuration Set | Enhanced Security - additional limitations on collaboration tools - This profile supports compliance with ASD's [*Hardening Microsoft Windows 10 version 21H1 Workstations*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/hardening-microsoft-windows-10-version-21h1-workstations) guidance and ISM PROTECTED Security Controls | Used for specialised use cases where users are managing or creating assets (Management Plane).               |

| `SOE`                    | `Information Workers`, `Remote Developer`, `Local Developer`, `Researcher` |

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}

Users who span different profiles require separate devices, i.e. a `Platform Administrator` would have both a SAW and SOE device.

### Device configuration set profiles

Endpoint Manager Configuration Profiles apply settings and features to devices. A collection of Configuration Profiles are assigned to devices as a Configuration Set depending on the machine usage. A naming convention is used to indicate which Configuration Profiles belong to which Configuration Set, the device components the settings relate to and the source for the setting.

Microsoft Intune applies settings through different types of Configuration Profiles, some due to legacy profiles (Administrative Templates, Custom Profiles), others due to group settings in other related settings (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint). Where available, Configuration Settings should use the modern `Setting Catalogue` profile type for applying settings. This enables easier resolution of setting conflicts.

The deployment of the settings, including any conflicts caused by implementation of a setting, can be monitored within Microsoft Intune [Device Profile Monitor.](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/configuration/device-profile-monitor)
