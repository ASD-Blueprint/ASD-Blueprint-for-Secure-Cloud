iOS devices are enrolled with the Microsoft Intune portal to gain secure access to organisational data. After devices are enrolled, they become `MANAGED`. Organisations can assign policies and apps to the device through a Mobile Device Management (MDM) provider, such as Microsoft Intune.

ASDâ€™s *Blueprint for Secure Cloud* (the Blueprint) recommends organisations secure iOS for devices based on a variety of hardening guidance including the United States' (US) National Information Assurance Partnership [*Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals version 3.3*](https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=468&id=468), the US Department of Defence's [*Cyber Exchange Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)*](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/), the Centre for Internet Security's(CIS) [*Apple iOS Benchmarks*](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/apple_ios), and ASD's [*Security Configuration Guidance for Apple iOS Devices*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/security-configuration-guide-apple-ios-14-devices) to provide secure access to corporate information.
