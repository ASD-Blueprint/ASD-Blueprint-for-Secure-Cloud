Microsoft Forms is a both a form and a survey tool. It offers a variety of external sharing and collaboration options including:
* **Sharing links** - Sharing the link to external party for form population.
* **Collaboration of layout and structure** - Collaboration on the design of a form.
* **Sharing templates** - Sharing a form as a template for external parties to leverage.
* **Sharing results** - Sharing the results of a form with external parties.

Forms can be configured to allow images from Bing and videos from YouTube to be embedded.

Microsoft Forms is capable of capturing the names of the organisational users who complete a form or survey. This functionality can also be configured globally or on a form-by-form basis.  

Surveys and forms can be leveraged for potentially malicious purposes. Phishing protection for Microsoft Forms scans forms for common phishing questions. If they are detected, the form is prevented from being distributed or shared. Phishing protection only protects internal organisation forms.

For new Microsoft 365 customers and those customers who have not previously used Forms, Microsoft Forms will store Forms data at rest within Australia. Existing customers should confirm the data storage location for Forms.
