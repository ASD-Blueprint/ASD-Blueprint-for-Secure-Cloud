Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies enable organisations to identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive information across Office 365 and endpoint devices. DLP policies can be targeted to one or more products within the Office 365 suite.

A DLP policy can be configured to:

* Identify sensitive information (Sensitive information types), documents in a specific site (for SharePoint only) or specific labels (sensitivity labels) contained in Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, locally on devices (endpoint DLP), and OneDrive for Business.
* Prevent end-users from accidentally sharing sensitive information.
* Prevent end-users from accidentally deleting a document.
* Update documents or emails based on sensitivity labels or data matching, used in conjunction with auto-labelling feature can assist with PSPF compliance
* Educate end-users by presenting messages them on how to stay compliant when relevant. This is done without interrupting their workflow.

Office 365 has over 200 prebuilt sensitive information types (Australian Passport Numbers etc.). In addition to the prebuilt sensitive information types custom types can be created. These custom types look for strings, patterns, or key words.

Note, endpoint DLP requires onboarding of those devices into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. organisations should consider the use of Endpoint DLP as part of a unified DLP strategy.

The Microsoft 365 Compliance Center provides the ability to monitor and review user and administrator activities across the Microsoft 365 applications from the past 90 days.

Audit logs are kept by default for 90 days but are configurable up to 10 years using an Audit retention policy with Microsoft Purview Audit (Premium).

When an event occurs for the respective application it will take anywhere from 30 minutes up to 24 hours before it can be viewed in the audit log search.

The Microsoft 365 Management Activity API enables third-party applications to consume audit logs from Microsoft 365. If audit logging is disabled, third-party applications can still consume audit logs from the Microsoft 365 Management Activity API.
