Legacy features allow for backwards compatibility for legacy capabilities from SharePoint on-premises to SharePoint Online. Legacy features are enabled only when there is a reason to do so, as they may restrict the features available within SharePoint Online. SharePoint Online provides legacy features by default to ensure backwards compatibility with legacy SharePoint on-premises solutions.
