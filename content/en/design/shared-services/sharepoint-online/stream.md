Stream (on SharePoint) is an intelligent enterprise video experience that is part of Microsoft 365. It enables users to record, upload, discover, share, and manage video just as they would any other file. Stream seamlessly integrates with apps across Microsoft 365, to provide the same experience regardless of where the user engages with the video content.

Microsoft Stream provides two platforms :

* Stream (on SharePoint) is uploading and using video files directly stored in SharePoint, Teams, and OneDrive.

* Stream (Classic) is using video files stored on the retiring Azure based microsoftstream.com service
