SharePoint Online provides the ability to create Intranet sites and Team Sites for groups to collaborate and manage their documents. A SharePoint site enables members of a team or from other teams to contribute content on a single platform. The information is limited to the members of the team or project.

The creation and storage sizing of SharePoint Online sites can be controlled. Out of the box, users can create SharePoint sites and these sites have no storage limits applied. Without restriction there is potentially a large management overhead so it is suggested to set the limit default to 200GB.

Administrators can put controls in place which restricts who can create a SharePoint site and set the size requirements.

| SharePoint site naming convention                          | Avoid spaces and special characters in site collection naming                                                                                         | Spaces and special characters can cause problems with indexing and extend the length of the path. Short names are easier to remember                                |
| Configure Site Storage limits                              | Configured                                                                                                                                            | Currently set to manually set site storage limits. Larger storage can increase management therefore default limit will be set to 200GB.                             |

Note that additional conditional access policy is in place to block legacy authentication access. |
| Use of Root site https://organisationsites.sharepoint.com/ | Root site to be used for future core Intranet site and joined with related sites via hub site functionality. Root site to be defined as the Home Site | Best practice to use root site for Intranet and set as Home Site as this makes it more intuitive for organisational users                                           |
