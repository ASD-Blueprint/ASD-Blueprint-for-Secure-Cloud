Sharing and Access controls  provide granular control over external sharing and access to SharePoint Online. Sharing and Access control is essential for securing SharePoint Online document and information sharing. Access to SharePoint Sites can be controlled through a variety of means to ensure that the data of the sites is protected. This includes the configuration of:

* Only allowing access from specific IP address locations
* Only allowing access from apps that use modern authentication
* Blocking access from devices which are not managed by the organisation through Microsoft Intune.
* Sites can be further secured through the implementation of Idle session timeouts. Idle session timeouts essentially act to log a user out of SharePoint after a period of inactivity.

Access Controls provides an administrative tool to restrict access contents in SharePoint.

| Sharing Controls | Configured      | Sharing to external users will be `disabled`.<br>Documents within SharePoint Online can only be shared with internal users. The default setting will be to share with "View" permissions which can be modified by the user to "Edit". Collaboration and sharing will be achieved using Teams. |
| Access Controls  | Configured      | Access to SharePoint Online will be controlled on a device level to ensure data is being accessed from approved devices.                                                                                                                                                                      |
