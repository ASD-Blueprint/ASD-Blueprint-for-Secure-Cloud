Microsoft Office Teams provides a Unified Communication (UC) capability that enables users to participate in audio-visual conferencing in meetings and on-demand.

Microsoft Office Teams can integrate with third-party UC products and provide configurable levels of functionality when integrated. Third party UC products will be the responsibility of the organisation.

Microsoft Office Teams can natively provide the following UC features:

* Individual and group voice calls
* Individual and group video calls
* Individual and group chat.
