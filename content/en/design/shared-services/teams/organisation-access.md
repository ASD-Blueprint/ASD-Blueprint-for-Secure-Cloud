Microsoft Teams is a collaboration platform that enables the organisation to work collaboratively with external organisations. This enables organisation users to collaborate internally, with trusted guest users and set up meetings with external users.

The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) Blueprint for Secure Cloud (The Blueprint) considers the following configurations:

* External Access - configures allowable domains to connect to the organisation's instance of Microsoft Teams. This also configures Skype for Business integration.
* Guest Access – when an external user is invited to be a member of the team. Once a team owner has granted someone guest access, they can access that team's resources, share files, and join a group chat with other team members.
* Teams Settings – configure the default behaviour of all users in the Teams application.
