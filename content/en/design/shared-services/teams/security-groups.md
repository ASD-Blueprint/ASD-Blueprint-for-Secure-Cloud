Dynamic Security Groups are Microsoft Entra ID security groups that are populated based on device and/or user attributes. Dynamic Security Groups can be leveraged to control access to locations, services and features.

The membership of a Dynamic Security Group is updated whenever an attribute of a device or user is modified. If the user/device no longer matches the Group rule, then that user/device is removed. Conversely if a user/device now matches the Group rule, then they are added. When a user is added the Group can be configured so that the added user receives an email notifying them of the addition.

Naming of Dynamic Security groups can be streamlined using a Naming Policy. The Naming Policy ensures that the groups within the environment conform to a standard and their purpose can be easily identified.

The Welcome Email setting is not able to be disabled across the organisation. The setting needs to be applied on individual Office 365 groups. This can be done programmatically: `_Set-UnifiedGroup <groupname> -UnifiedGroupWelcomeMessageEnabled:$false_`
