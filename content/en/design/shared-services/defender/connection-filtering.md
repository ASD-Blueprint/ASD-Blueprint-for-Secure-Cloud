Connection filtering within Exchange Online Protection refers to the verification of the sender using SPF, DKIM, DMARC and Microsoft intelligence.

Exchange Online Protection Connection Filtering is always enabled however it can, to a degree, be configured. A connection filter can be implemented to always allow or always block traffic based upon an IP list.
