ATP anti-phishing protects users by checking incoming messages for indicators that the message may be spoofed by impersonator or part of a phishing campaign. Most phishing emails involves a malicious actor disguising oneself (spoofing) as an individual who is known to the recipient. The messaged is crafted in a such a way which can trick the user into clicking a link, downloading malware, or stealing user credentials.

Anti-phishing uses mailbox intelligence to build a profile of communication habits between each user and maps out these relationship patterns. In an event of a phishing campaign ATP will analyse the message behaviour against the user profiles to determine if the sender is legitimate or an impersonator.

Anti-spoof specifically analyses the senders address to determine if it is legitimate or forged. Administrators can allow our block specific users from spoofing an internal domain. i.e. An external organisation to send out advertising or products on behalf of the organisation.
