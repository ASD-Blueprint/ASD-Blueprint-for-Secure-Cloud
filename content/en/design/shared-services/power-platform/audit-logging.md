description: "This section describes the design decisions associated with Power Platform specific audit logging for system(s) built using ASD's Blueprint for Secure Cloud."

Power Platform activities are logged as follows:

* **Power Apps** – written to unified audit log.
* **Power Automate** – written to unified audit log. 
* **Power BI** – written to unified audit log and additional Power BI activity log. 
* **DLP Policy** – creation, update, and deletion written to unified audit log.

**Note:**  
* Dataverse and model-driven apps logging is stored within Dataverse. 
* Alerting can be triggered via unified audit log alert policies or via integration with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution.
