The Power Platform is made up of the following services. 

* **Microsoft Power Apps**: an application with services, connectors and a data platform that provides a rapid development environment for building custom apps for organisation needs
* **Microsoft Power Automate**:  lets organisations create automated workflows between applications and services, for example to synchronise files, get notifications, and collect data
* **Microsoft Power BI**: a business analytics service that delivers visual insights to enable fast, informed decisions. Users can collaboratively create and share customised dashboards and interactive reports
* **AI Builder** - a Power Platform capability that helps quickly bring AI to apps and flows that connect to business data. AI Builder provides prebuilt AI models, where organisations do not need to gather data to build and train the model, as well as the ability to create custom AI models  
* **Power Virtual Agents** : enables easy creation of bots using a guided, no-code graphical interface without the need for data scientists or developers
* **Microsoft Power Automate RPA** – An additional robotic process automation (RPA) capability within Microsoft Power Automate that enables automation of manual business processes across on-premises, cloud apps and services 
* **Power Apps Portals** – an additional service that delivers a complete content management system out of the box, with all content stored in Dataverse. Content can be edited through Power Apps Portals Studio or directly by using the Portal Management app
* **Microsoft Power Pages** (*currently preview*) - a secure, enterprise-grade, low-code software as a service (SaaS) platform for creating, hosting, and administering modern external-facing business websites.  
Note that only the following services are included in the current Microsoft 365 E5 Licensing. All other services require additional licensing
* **Power Apps for Office 365** – excluding premium connectors plus integration with Dataverse 
* **Power Automate for Office 365** - excluding premium connectors plus integration with Dataverse 
* **Power BI Pro** – which includes the ability to share reports and dashboards with internal colleagues
* **Power Virtual Agents for Teams** – excluding the capability to build standalone chat bots.
