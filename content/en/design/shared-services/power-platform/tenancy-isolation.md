With tenant restrictions, the organisation can control access to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud applications, based on the Entra ID tenant the applications use for single sign-on. With tenant restrictions, the organisation can specify the list of tenants that their users are permitted to access. Entra ID then only grants access to these permitted tenants using Entra ID based tenant restriction. 

Additionally, if the organisation wants to enforce tenant isolation for Microsoft Power Platform connections, then they can use Power Platformâ€™s tenant isolation capability. Note that the Power Platform tenant isolation feature does not impact Entra ID based access outside of Power Apps and Power Automate. Power Platform tenant isolation only works for connectors using Entra ID based authentication such as Office 365 Outlook or SharePoint. 

Organisations wanting to block connectors that use external identity providers such as Microsoft account, Google, etc., can create a data loss prevention policy and classify the connector under the Blocked group. See [Connectors and Data Loss Prevention Policies]({{< ref "connectors-dlp-policies">}}).

Power Platform tenant isolation ability is available with two options: one-way or two-way restriction.
