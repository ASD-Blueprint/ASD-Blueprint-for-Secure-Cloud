Microsoft Exchange Online is the Microsoft 365 cloud-hosted messaging solution that has similar capabilities of on-premises Exchange services. Exchange Online provides email, calendar, contacts, and tasks. It supports mailbox delegation, where a delegate can have send-on-behalf and management rights over other mailboxes. Shared mailboxes can be assigned to and administered by many users. Application mail sending is supported where the application can authenticate against the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) message submission to users inside the managed environment or authenticated SMTP message relay to addresses outside the managed environment.

Organisations should also refer to Mail Flow and Gateway for more information on mail flows, mail gateways and the use of GovLink.
