A Resource Mailbox is a mailbox which is assigned to a resource as opposed to a user.

Resource Mailboxes have two types:

* **Room mailboxes** – Used for meeting rooms
* **Equipment mailboxes** – Used for non-location specific resources such as computers, projectors, microphones, or cars

Users book these resources using meeting requests. Resource Mailboxes can be configured to accept or decline the request based on their availability.

Room Mailboxes can be sorted into lists using Room Lists. Room Lists are leveraged to simplify the booking process by grouping all rooms that meet a certain requirement together (Room lists are usually configured by location). When a user books a meeting, they can select the appropriate room list and then see the available rooms for that time.
