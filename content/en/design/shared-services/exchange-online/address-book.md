The Outlook Address Lists, Global Address List (GAL), and Offline Address Book (OAB) are collections of mail-enabled objects. They are leveraged for recipient lookup operations (i.e. When a user leverages either the Address book or Check names tools in Outlook). The types of mail-enabled object collections are as follows:

* **GAL** – The GAL is automatically created by Exchange and lists all mail-enabled objects. (The GAL is available by default to all users).
* **OAB** – The OAB is an offline version of the GAL leveraged by clients in Cached Mode.
* **Outlook Address List** - An Outlook Address List is a subset of the mail-enabled objects. By default, a number of Address Lists are created, however, additional Address Lists can be created as required.
