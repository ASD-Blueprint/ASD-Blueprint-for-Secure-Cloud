The implementation of Exchange Online can be coupled with a migration from the existing on-premises Exchange infrastructure. If a migration is not required, the deployment is referred to as a greenfield deployment of Exchange Online. There are three migration options:

* **Hybrid Migration** – Often referred to as a staged migration, is where the on-premises Exchange environment is extended to Office 365 through departmental relationships or federation. During migration user mailboxes will be spread between the online and on-premises environments, this necessitates planning to ensure free/busy, calendar and mailbox sharing all continue to work.
* **Cutover Migration** – A cutover migration is only recommended for organisations with less than 150 mailboxes and occurs over one or a few days. During this period email access may be unavailable. Prior to the migration event, a connection between the on-premises Exchange organisation and Exchange Online needs to be established.
* **PST Migration** – A Personal Storage Table (PST) migration is where PST files with a mapping file are either shipped to or uploaded into Office 365. The Exchange Online instance is a greenfield deployment with no configuration required on the on-premises Exchange environment.
