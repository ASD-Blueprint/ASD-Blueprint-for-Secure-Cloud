description: "This section describes the design decisions associated with Services and Add-Ins for system(s) built using ASD's Blueprint for Secure Cloud."
---

Microsoft 365 centrally manages services and add-ins and can can enhance both the way in which information is accessed and the way in which organisation conducts their business. Enabling services and add-ins also introduces risks to the environment therefore the organisation. Out of the box, several services and add-ins are configured within the portal.

The below design decisions are based on general requirements and consider the location of the hosting application. Organisations should undertake a risk assessment of each of the services and add-ins to ensure alignment with the organisational risk appetite.
