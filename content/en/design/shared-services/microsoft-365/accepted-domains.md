Accepted Domains are SMTP namespaces configured within Exchange Online. Only emails addressed to users within the nominated domains are accepted.

Accepted Domains consist of the following types:

* **Authoritative Domains** - Authoritative Domains are domains where the Exchange Organisation accepts messages addressed to recipients and is responsible for generating non-delivery reports. On creation of an Exchange Online organisation the tenant domain Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and the `<tenantname>.mail.onmicrosoft.com` FQDN are automatically populated as an Authoritative Domains; and
* **Relay Domains** - Relay Domains are often called Non-Authoritative Domains. The Exchange Organisation will accept the messages addressed to the recipients; however, it is not responsible for generating non-delivery reports. Hybrid Exchange leverages Relay Domains and mail connectors to relay messages between both on-premises infrastructure and Exchange Online.
