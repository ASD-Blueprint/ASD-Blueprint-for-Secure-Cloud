---

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is not a new concept. Microsoft's implementation of RBAC in the context of Microsoft 365 is the process and mechanism of maintaining the principal of least privilege within an environment. Roles therefore define **what** the role holder can do, **who** is granted the role, and **where** the scope of the role is valid. The following list provides an overview of the concepts associated with RBAC:

* Security Principal: The identity assigned a role and given permissions for a specific task
* Role Group: A collection of permissions
* Management Role: A specific permission defined for a particular workload such as Exchange Online or Teams
* Role Assignment: Assignment of a Role Group to a Security Principal
* Scoping: Restricting the Role Assignment to a defined set of resources or objects 

Many of the workloads within Microsoft 365 can be managed through use of one or more default administrative roles defined within Entra ID; however, there are a lot of Microsoft 365 workloads that employ their own RBAC concepts as well as maintaining some overlap with Entra ID. This overlap varies according to the workload. Roles supported by each product are outlined below:

### Privileged Identity Management

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) can be leveraged to enhance the RBAC model for Entra ID role-based management access and other workloads. PIM requests are made through the Entra portal for elevated access only when required, and for a defined period of time.

PIM enables assignment of the following default Microsoft 365 roles:

* Exchange administrator
* Exchange recipient administrator
* SharePoint administrator
* Teams administrator
* Teams Communications administrator
* Teams Communications support engineer
* Teams Communications support specialist
* Power BI Administrator
* Power Platform administrator
* Customer Lockbox Administrator
* Intune administrator
* Office Apps administrator
* Message Center Privacy Reader
* Message Center Reader
* Security administrator
* Security reader

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}

Using PIM for the SharePoint administrator role, the Device administrator role, and roles trying to access the Microsoft Security and Compliance Center might experience delays of up to a few hours after activating the role, see [PIM Roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-roles) for further information.

| Microsoft 365 administrative sub-roles | Configured by Exception | Microsoft 365 administrative sub-roles, where possible, will not be configured in favour of PIM. This ensures Azure is the location to manage Role Base Access Control permission for the organisations tenant. |
