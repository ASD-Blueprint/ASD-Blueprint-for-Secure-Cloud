Self-Service purchase add-ins for Microsoft 365 enables users of Microsoft 365 to purchase third party add-ins for the relevant Microsoft 365 tenancy.

By default self-service purchase of applications from Microsoft Power Platform products is enabled for all users within the tenant. To purchase these applications users must pay with a credit card.

The processing of data for these add-ins does not sit within Microsoft 365 tenancy, which may result in data transmission or storage out of Australia.
