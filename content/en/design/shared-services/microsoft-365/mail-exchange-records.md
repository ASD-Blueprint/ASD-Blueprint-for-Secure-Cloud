Mail Exchange (MX) records specify the mail server responsible for accepting mail on behalf of the domain. The record is a resource in the Domain Name System (DNS), and it is possible for a single domain to have multiple MX records. Multiple records are largely configured for availability, redundancy, and load balancing reasons.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}

MX records should be maintained within the Australian Protective Domain Name (AUPDNS) service - as per ASD's [*Gateway Security Guidance Package: Gateway Technology Guide*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/gateway-hardening/gateway-security-guidance-package-gateway-technology-guides).

| Authoritative DNS MX Record | Configured      | If the organisation hosts mail for more than one domain a MX record for each is required. These records are listed.              |
| Mail Exchanger/s            | Configured      | If the organisation requires its on-premises mail gateways to continue to be used, the Virtual IP (VIP) of the gateways is used. |
