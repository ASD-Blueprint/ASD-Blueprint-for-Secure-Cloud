The OneDrive sharing administration screen provides granular configuration. Controlling OneDrive sharing ensures that data is shared internally and externally in a secure manner. OneDrive provides end users the ability to securely store their personal data in Office 365. The design considers that OneDrive is used for personal storage and sharing within the organisation.
