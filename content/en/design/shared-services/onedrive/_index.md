OneDrive for Business is a cloud-based, secure, personal document store. It enables storage and access of files from any approved device, offline editing, simple organisational collaboration, search tools, and advanced encryption and security features. The sharing of information assets from OneDrive for Business can be controlled to allow or deny sharing with external parties.

OneDrive data can be configured to automatically synchronise data, and from this, ensure the user does not need to download files every time they wish to access them.

On deletion of a user's OneDrive account, content can be deleted or retained for a specified period.
