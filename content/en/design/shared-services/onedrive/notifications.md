Notifications provide OneDrive users with information about how OneDrive is operating. The notification administration screen provides notification control to OneDrive owners. The design considers notification and alerting of users, and so all shared documents in the organisation and their users, are aware of the status of shared documents. Users can be notified by email when:

* Other users invite additional users.
* External users accept invitations.
* An anonymous access link is created or changed.
