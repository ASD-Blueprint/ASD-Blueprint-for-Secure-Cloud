{{% alert title="Instruction" color="dark" %}}

The cryptography section of a System Security Plan (SSP) should document an organisation's approach to cryptography, TLS, SSH, S/MiME and IPSec. As with other sections of the SSP, information in the email section should be documented according to the relevant controls outlined in ASD's ISM and the SSP Annex. 

All template text refers to a typical implementation of a system built using the Blueprint, and includes reference to organisational policies, processes and technical configurations to be implemented in addition to the technical controls that may be configured using guidance from the Blueprint. Any implementation implied by the below text should not be considered as prescriptive of how organisations must scope, build, document, or assess its system.

When completing the below template, organisations should insert and update information where relevant to ensure it accurately represents their approach to cryptography, TLS, SSH, S/MiME and IPSec. When complete, remove any instructional boxes throughout.

`<INSERT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS APPROPRIATE>`

#### Technical controls implemented

Technical controls for `<SYSTEM-NAME>`'s implementation of AACAs are configured with reference to ASD's [*Blueprint for Secure Cloud*](https://blueprint.asd.gov.au) including the following technical configurations:

* BitLocker is configured to use AES-256 encryption.

`<SYSTEM-NAME>`'s use of Microsoft 365 also inherits the following technical configurations from Microsoft:

* Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 services:
* implement AACAs where possible
* implement Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) as the preferred algorithm
* do not use Diffie-Hellman (DH)
* do not use Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
* implement National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) P-256 and P-384
* use a 256-bit key where possible for Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
* use a 2048-bit key for Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)
* use separate RSA key pairs for these purposes
* use SHA-384 as the preferred hashing algorithm for Microsoft 365 TLS components.

* Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 services: 
* implement TLS
* however, `<ORGANISATION-NAME>` notes that Microsoft services do not currently allow organisations to select which TLS versions to use
* implement AES in Galois Counter Mode (GCM)
* implement secure renegotiation
* implement ECDHE as the preferred algorithm
* Perfect Forward Secrecy is used when ECDHE is prioritised
* use SHA-2 based certificates
* use SHA-2 as part of the Message Authentication Code and Pseudo-Random Function
* disable TLS compression.

### Secure Shell (SSH)

#### Applicability

The section of the SSP is not applicable as `<SYSTEM-NAME>` does not directly implement Secure Shell (SSH) in its administration or configuration. However, `<SYSTEM-NAME>` does rely on other systems and services that implement SSH as part of their administration and configuration.

In particular, `<SYSTEM-NAME>` uses both physical and logical networking components as implemented by Microsoft as part of its Microsoft 365 services. `<ORGANISATION-NAME>` has assessed the implementation of these components as documented in Microsoft's IRAP assessments, and available in Microsoft's [Service Trust Portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/), and is satisfied with their implementation as they relate to `<SYSTEM-NAME>`.

If and when SSH is implemented in future use as part of `<SYSTEM-NAME>`, `<ORGANISATION-NAME>` will assess and implement appropriate security controls in relation to its configuration at that time.
