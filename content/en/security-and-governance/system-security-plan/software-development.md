{{% alert title="Instruction" color="dark" %}}

The software development section of a System Security Plan (SSP) should document an organisation's approach to application and web application development. As with other sections of the SSP, information in the software development section should be documented according to the relevant controls outlined in ASD's ISM and the SSP Annex. 

All template text refers to a typical implementation of a system built using the Blueprint, and includes reference to organisational policies, processes and technical configurations to be implemented in addition to the technical controls that may be configured using guidance from the Blueprint. Any implementation implied by the below text should not be considered as prescriptive of how organisations must scope, build, document, or assess its system.

When completing the below template, organisations should insert and update information where relevant to ensure it accurately represents their approach to system administration, patching and backups and restoration. When complete, remove any instructional boxes throughout.

As `<ORGANISATION-NAME>`'s approach to implementing controls related to software development is consistent across all controls addressed within this section, it does not delve into subsections but rather addresses the controls as a group. This approach is consistent with ASD's [*Guidelines for Software Development*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism/cyber-security-guidelines/guidelines-software-development).

#### Applicability

This section of the SSP is not applicable as `<SYSTEM-NAME>` does not include any applications nor web applications developed by `<ORGANISATION-NAME>`, including as part of `<SYSTEM-NAME>`'s core operation.

If and when the development of applications or web applications is considered for future use within the system boundary of `<SYSTEM-NAME>`, `<ORGANISATION-NAME>` will assess and implement appropriate security controls in relation to their use at that time.

However, `<SYSTEM-NAME>` does leverage software developed by Microsoft as part of its Microsoft 365 services. `<ORGANISATION-NAME>` has assessed Microsoft's practices for the development of software as documented in Microsoft's IRAP assessments, and available in Microsoft's [Service Trust Portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/) and is satisfied with their implementation as they relate to `<SYSTEM-NAME>`.
